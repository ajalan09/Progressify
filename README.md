## WeightTrack
WeightTrack is an iOS app that enables the user track his fitness progress not only through his weight, but also through his transformation pictures. I was motivated to develop this app because I personally went through a huge weight loss transformation where I lost over 50 pounds, and during my journey, I was dissapointed with the currently-available weight management apps, as none of them had a feature of comparing transformation pictures. 

## Design of the App

Using the Sketch software, I was able to design a mock up of the mobile app. After going through 10+ iterations (one of them shown below as Fig 1) and recieving user feedback, I was able to come up with a final design (Fig 2).

## Features
#### 1. Home Screen
The home screen of the application displays the user's goal weight (which the user can edit at any time), initial weight, and current weight. More importantly, it also displays the user's past entries, showcasing his progress through it. Fig 3 and 4 show how the design was successfully converted into the actual app's home screen.

#### 2. Progress Entry Screen
The progress entry screen displays, in more detail, each of the entries that the user submitted. It displays the date on which the entry was submitted, the user's weight at that time, the amount of weight he lost/gained since the beginning of his journey, and his progress pictures that he submitted (which can be toggled to see a front, side and back view). Fig 5 showcases a screenshot of my Progress Entry Screen.
