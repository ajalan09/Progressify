## Progressify
Progressify is an iOS app that enables the user to track his fitness progress not only through his weight, but also through his transformation pictures. I was motivated to develop this app because I personally went through a huge weight loss transformation where I lost over 50 pounds, and during my journey, I was disappointed with the currently-available weight management apps, as none of them had a feature of comparing transformation pictures. 

## Design of the App

Using the Sketch software, I was able to design a mock up of the mobile app. After going through 10+ iterations (one of them shown below as Fig 1) and receiving user feedback, I was able to come up with a final design (Fig 2).

## Features
#### 1. Home Screen
The home screen of the application displays the user's goal weight (which the user can edit at any time), initial weight, and current weight. More importantly, it also displays the user's past entries, showcasing his progress through it. Fig 3 and 4 show how the design was successfully converted into the actual app's home screen.

#### 2. Progress Entry View
The progress entry view displays, in more detail, each of the entries that the user submitted. It displays the date on which the entry was submitted, the user's weight at that time, the amount of weight he lost/gained since the beginning of his journey, and his progress pictures that he submitted (which can be toggled to see a front, side and back view). Fig 5 showcases a screenshot of my Progress Entry View of two of my entries, whereas Fig 6 is a Demo of how the Progress View functions.

#### 3. Transformation View
The transformation view is the Unique Selling Point (USP) of the app! It allows the user to compare his transformation pictures from any of his entries with front/side/back view to be able to see how he has progressed in his fitness journey! Fig 7 showcases a screenshot of my Transformation View comparing my initial photo with my very last photo, whereas Fig 8 is a Demo of how the Transformation Screen functions.

Please note that this view will change slightly to make the transformation pictures larger and display the user's weight alongside the pictures.


#### 4. Graph View
The graph view will display a simplistic chart mapping the user's progress. This view is under construction.

## Languages/Frameworks used
* Swift (SwiftUI, CoreData)
* Sketch


## Tests
The mobile application was tested using the Time Profiler tool in XCode, and helped drastically increase the speed of the app by identifying time-heavy functions. 

## How to use?
The app is currently being beta-tested, and will soon be released on the App Store (hopefully by October!)
