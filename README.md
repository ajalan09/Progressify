## WeightTrack
WeightTrack is an iOS app that enables the user track his fitness progress not only through his weight, but also through his transformation pictures. I was motivated to develop this app because I personally went through a huge weight loss transformation where I lost over 50 pounds, and during my journey, I was dissapointed with the currently-available weight management apps, as none of them had a feature of comparing transformation pictures. 

## Design of the App

Using the Sketch software, I was able to design a mock up of the mobile app. After going through 10+ iterations (one of them shown below as Fig 1)and recieving user feedback, I was able to come up with a final design (Fig 2)
